Review

I learned a lot during the process of this project. I experimented with
creating masks and different blends(e.g. the text experiment
below the Lorem Ipsum page). Because of this, I think my typography
experiments are the strongest. I think my color choice worked well with my
theme which takes after architecture in old Montserrat in Argentina.

The most difficult part of this project
was trying to include a slider with the different weights of the text.
Upon submission, there is a glitch still occuring with this feature that
I am currently trying to fix. I managed to get the buttons and the slider
itself to work normally; however, when initially clicked, the whole Weight
page shifts, and I am currently not sure as to why.I also incorporated grids into my webpage (in the Lorem Ipsum page content and in
the footer). I think if I were to do another website, I would make the
entire website with a grid layout.
